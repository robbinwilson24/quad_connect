## Description <a name="program-description"></a>
This is a user-friendly browser-based imitation of a game of Connect 4, created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
The program alternates between players who will take turns placing a piece in an available cell. 
Once the game detects that 4 of the same colour pieces are in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally), the game ends and a winner is declared. 
Styles are updated dynamically throughout. 



## Features <a name="features"></a>
The game has the following features:
    - Dynamic population of the game board grid from JavaScript based on the gameArrays data structure.
    - The game enforces the rule that pieces stack from the bottom and cannot float.
    - The current player's turn is indicated by highlighting their respective player element.
    - Winning combinations are checked after each move to determine the winner.
    - The winning player's class is updated, and a winning message is displayed.
    - The game can detect a draw if no winner is found after 42 moves.
    - The new game button allows resetting the game and clearing the game board.



## Technologies Used <a name="technologies"></a>

- HTML - Used for initial page set-up.
